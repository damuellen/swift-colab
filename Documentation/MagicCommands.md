# Magic Commands

The Swift kernel has various built-in commands for downloading dependencies and interacting with the operating system. These commands start with `%` and behave like the IPython [magic commands](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/magics.html). They take the role of inline Shell commands in Python notebooks, which start with `!`.

- [`%include`](#include)
- [`%install`](#install)
- [`%install-extra-include-command`](#install-extra-include-command)
- [`%install-location`](#install-location)
- [`%install-swiftpm-environment`](#install-swiftpm-environment)
- [`%install-swiftpm-flags`](#install-swiftpm-flags)
- [`%install-swiftpm-import`](#install-swiftpm-import)
- [`%system`](#system)
- [`%test`](#test)

> Some of this documentation is a work in progress.

Magic commands are implemented in [PreprocessAndExecute.swift](https://github.com/philipturner/swift-colab/blob/main/Sources/JupyterKernel/SwiftKernel/PreprocessAndExecute.swift) and [ProcessInstalls.swift](https://github.com/philipturner/swift-colab/blob/main/Sources/JupyterKernel/SwiftKernel/ProcessInstalls.swift).

## Execution Behavior

Before executing a code block, the kernel extracts all magic commands and executes them in the order they appear. The commands are oblivious to the surrounding Swift code. In contrast, a Python notebook executes Shell commands according to the control flow of their surrounding code. For example, this code in a Swift notebook:
```swift
for _ in 0..<2 {
%system echo "A"
  print("B")
%system echo "C"
  print("D")
}
```
Produces (replacing newlines with spaces):
```
A C B D B D
```

While this code in a Python notebook:
```python
for i in range(2):
  !echo A
  print('B')
  !echo C
  print('D')
```
Produces (replacing newlines with spaces):
```
A B C D A B C D
```

## `%include`
```
%include PATH 
```

Inject code from a source file into the interpreter. The code executes at the top of the current cell, even if the `%include` command appears below other Swift code.

- `PATH` - File path relative to the current working directory (`/content`), omitting the first forward flash. If the file does not exist there, it looks inside `/opt/swift/include`.

The command silently fails if you previously included `PATH` during the current Jupyter session. This protective mechanism prevents duplication of the `SwiftShell` Python object in `EnableIPythonDisplay.swift`. Swift-Colab v2.3 will restore old behavior from [swift-jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter), where a file can be included multiple times and in the middle of a cell.

## `%install`
```
%install SPEC PRODUCT [PRODUCT ...]
```

Build a Swift package for use inside a notebook. If a previous Jupyter session executed this command, import the cached build products. To avoid recompilation, the SwiftPM flags should match those present when the `%install` command last executed.

- `SPEC` - Specification to insert into a package manifest. Prefer to use SwiftPM version 5.0\* syntax, such as `.package(url: "", branch: ""))`, although v4.2 syntax also works for backward compatibility. Place the specification between single quotes to avoid colliding with string literals, which use double quotes.
- `PRODUCT` - Each exported Swift module the debugger should build and import.

> \*v5.0 syntax will be supported in Swift-Colab v2.3. Until that happens, use v4.2 syntax such as `.package(url: "", .branch(""))`.

Although the SwiftPM engine utilizes cached build products, LLDB does not automatically detect those products. `%install` tells the Jupyter kernel to locate and optionally recompile each `PRODUCT`. Always run the command before using external dependencies in a notebook.

To build packages stored on the local computer, pass `$cwd` into `.package(path: "")`. This keyword substitutes with the current working directory, which is always `/content`. The example below demonstrates directory substitution.

```swift
// Install the SimplePackage package that's in the kernel's working directory.
%install '.package(path: "$cwd/SimplePackage")' SimplePackage
```

## `%install-extra-include-command`
```
%install-extra-include-command EXECUTABLE [ARGUMENT ...]
```

- Link to forum thread that initiated this

## `%install-location`
```
%install-location PATH
```

- Link to PR that initiated this
- Has `$cwd` substitution (describe).

## `%install-swiftpm-environment`
```
%install-swiftpm-environment EXECUTABLE [ARGUMENT ...]
%install-swiftpm-environment export KEY=VALUE
```

> Coming in Swift-Colab v2.3.

Adds a line of Bash code to execute before building the package.


## `%install-swiftpm-flags`
```
%install-swiftpm-flags [FLAG ...]
%install-swiftpm-flags $clear
```

- Appends the arguments to a growing list of flags every time you execute
- The `$clear` flag was added to allow emptying SwiftPM flags. If you have `$clear` before other flags, it resets then adds the flags to the right of it.
- Explain workaround for `-Xcc -I/...` flags, but for now just hyperlink: [problem 4 in this comment](https://github.com/philipturner/swift-colab/issues/14#issuecomment-1158237894).
- `$clear` also resets anything added by `%install-swiftpm-environment` or `%install-swiftpm-import`, but not `%install-location`.

## `%install-swiftpm-import`
```
%install-swiftpm-import MODULE
```

> Coming in Swift-Colab v2.3.

Treats a previously compiled module like a library built into the Swift toolchain. This lets a Swift package's source code import the module, without declaring a dependency in `Package.swift`.

- `MODULE` - The Swift module to automatically link. Before running `%install-swiftpm-import`, execute the `%include` command that declares this module

This command's underlying mechanism is used to inject `JupyterDisplay` into Swift packages. This module lets external packages seamlessly communicate with the notebook's Jupyter display. Use the convention below to conditionally import `MODULE` inside a Swift package.

```swift
#if canImport(JupyterDisplay)
import JupyterDisplay
#endif

#if canImport(JupyterDisplay)
// Use symbols defined in the 'JupyterDisplay' module.
#endif
```

## `%system`
```
%system EXECUTABLE [ARGUMENT ...]
```

- Executes a command-line command, executes before the code in the cell
- Forwards stdout just like Python bash commands, but not stdin (tracked by https://github.com/philipturner/swift-colab/issues/17)
- Works in Python mode because itâ€™s a Jupyter magic command. The Python mode version prints the output like a comma-separated list instead of actual stdout.

```swift
%system cd "sample_data" && touch "$(uname -m).sh"
```
The code above works and makes a file called `x86_64.sh` in `/content/sample_data`.

## `%test`
```
%test SPEC
```

> Coming in Swift-Colab v2.3.

Run Swift package tests on the package specified by `SPEC`. This does not share build products with any corresponding `%install` command, but it does cache build products from previous test runs. If you both install and test the same package in a Jupyter notebook, you will spend twice as long waiting for compilation to finish.

- `SPEC` - Specification to insert into a package manifest. Prefer to use SwiftPM version 5.0\* syntax, such as `.package(url: "", branch: ""))`, although v4.2 syntax also works for backward compatibility. Place the specification between single quotes to avoid colliding with string literals, which use double quotes.

> \*v5.0 syntax will be supported in Swift-Colab v2.3. Until that happens, use v4.2 syntax such as `.package(url: "", .branch(""))`.

This command utilizes the same SwiftPM flags as `%install`, providing a convenient way to configure and run tests in Colaboratory. The following commands affect how tests compile:

```
%install-extra-include-command
%install-location
%install-swiftpm-environment
%install-swiftpm-flags
%install-swiftpm-import
```
